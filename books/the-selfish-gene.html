                <h2>The Selfish Gene</h2>
                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Richard Dawkins<br>
                <strong>First Read:</strong> 2026-02-11</p>

                <h2>Why This Book Matters</h2>

                <p>Munger called this one of the most important books he ever read. Not because he was interested in biology per se — because he was interested in <em>how things actually work.</em> And evolution, it turns out, explains a lot about business, markets, and human behavior that economics alone can't touch.</p>

                <p>Dawkins's central argument: evolution doesn't operate at the level of species or even individuals. It operates at the level of genes. Organisms are just vehicles — survival machines built by genes to propagate copies of themselves. Everything from altruism to aggression, from cooperation to competition, makes sense once you see it through the gene's-eye view.</p>

                <p>This is the kind of book that rearranges how you think. After reading it, you start seeing gene-level logic everywhere — in corporate incentive structures, in market dynamics, in why certain business models survive and others don't.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                <h3>Replicators Win — Always</h3>
                <p>Dawkins starts with the origin of life: molecules that could copy themselves. The ones that copied best survived. That's it. That's the whole engine. Everything else — cells, organisms, brains, civilizations — is downstream of replication.</p>

                <p>For investing, this is a powerful frame. Businesses that can replicate their model — franchise by franchise, market by market, user by user — have an evolutionary advantage over businesses that can't. McDonald's isn't a hamburger company. It's a replication machine. So is Visa. So is Costco. The product matters, but the ability to copy the formula across geographies and decades matters more.</p>

                <h3>The Survival Machine</h3>
                <p>Genes build organisms to survive and reproduce. The organism doesn't "know" this — it just follows the incentives baked into its design. Resistance to pain, craving for sugar, fear of heights. The genes programmed the machine, then let it loose.</p>

                <p>Corporations are survival machines too. The incentive structures — compensation, promotion criteria, capital allocation rules — are the "genes." The employees are the organism, responding to those incentives whether they understand them or not. When I evaluate a company, I should be looking at the incentive architecture as closely as I look at the balance sheet. What behaviors does the system reward? That's what you'll get.</p>

                <h3>Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS)</h3>
                <p>Dawkins spends a chapter on game theory and ESS — strategies that, once adopted by a population, can't be invaded by a competing strategy. Hawks and doves. Tit-for-tat. The math is elegant, but the application is what matters.</p>

                <p>Markets are ecosystems. Business strategies are like species competing for resources. An ESS in business is a competitive equilibrium — the state where no competitor can profitably enter or change strategy. That's another way of describing a moat. A business with a true moat has found an evolutionarily stable strategy. Competitors <em>could</em> try to invade, but the math doesn't work for them.</p>

                <h3>Altruism Isn't What It Looks Like</h3>
                <p>Dawkins explains apparent altruism — bees dying to protect the hive, birds giving alarm calls — through kin selection. The gene doesn't care about the individual organism. It cares about copies of itself, wherever they sit. So a bee sacrifices itself because the hive carries copies of its genes.</p>

                <p>This reframes "corporate culture." When employees go above and beyond, are they altruistic? Or is the incentive structure (equity, belonging, shared mission) creating kin-selection dynamics where individual sacrifice benefits the collective — and the individuals' equity stake? Companies that create genuine alignment between individual and collective incentives aren't just nice places to work. They're running better evolutionary math.</p>

                <h3>Memes — The Other Replicator</h3>
                <p>Dawkins coined the word "meme" in this book — not internet jokes, but units of cultural transmission. Ideas, songs, fashions, techniques. Memes replicate, mutate, and compete for survival in the ecosystem of human minds, just like genes in the biosphere.</p>

                <p>Brands are memes. "Just Do It" is a meme. "Think Different" is a meme. The strongest brands aren't just marketing — they're replicators that have colonized millions of minds and resist displacement. Brand durability, seen through this lens, is memetic fitness. How easily does the idea copy? How resistant is it to competing memes?</p>

                <h2>Connections to Investing</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Replication as moat:</strong> The businesses I want to own are the ones whose model copies cleanly. Low marginal cost of replication + high fidelity = durable advantage. Software, franchises, network effects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incentive architecture > stated values:</strong> Don't read the mission statement. Read the proxy. How is the CEO paid? How are managers promoted? What gets measured? The incentive genes determine the organism's behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>ESS as moat analysis:</strong> Instead of just asking "does this company have a moat?" ask "is this competitive position an evolutionarily stable strategy?" Can any mutant strategy invade profitably? If not, the moat is real.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memetic brand strength:</strong> A brand that people spread voluntarily — that friends tell friends about — is a replicator. A brand that requires constant ad spend to survive is a non-replicator being kept alive artificially.</li>
                    <li><strong>Survival of the fittest ≠ survival of the strongest.</strong> It's survival of the best-adapted. Small, nimble businesses can outcompete large ones when the environment shifts. This is why I watch for technological disruption — it's an environmental change that can make previously fit strategies suddenly unfit.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What I'd Tell Someone Over Coffee</h2>

                <p>You know what floored me? The memes chapter. Dawkins wrote it almost as an afterthought — a final chapter speculating that genes aren't the only replicators on Earth. Ideas copy themselves too. He coined a term that would go on to define internet culture, but his actual point was deeper: <em>any</em> system with replication, variation, and selection will evolve. That's not biology. That's math.</p>

                <p>And once you see it that way, markets are just another evolutionary system. Business models replicate (franchises, licensing, network effects). They vary (innovation, pivots, experiments). And they get selected by the market — the ones that serve customers best at the lowest cost survive, the rest die.</p>

                <p>The real lesson isn't any single insight from the book. It's the <em>lens</em>. Munger talks about building a latticework of mental models from multiple disciplines. Dawkins hands you one of the most powerful models on the latticework: evolution by natural selection. Once you can think in those terms — replicators, selection pressure, stable strategies, fitness landscapes — you see patterns in business that are invisible without it.</p>

                <p>Also, it's just beautifully written. Dawkins explains complex ideas with the kind of clarity that makes you feel smarter for having read it. That's rare in science writing. Buffett does the same thing with investing. There's something to that — the people who truly understand a subject can explain it simply. The ones who can't are usually faking it.</p>
