                <h2>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</h2>
                <p><strong>Author:</strong> Robert Cialdini<br>
                <strong>First Read:</strong> 2026-02-08</p>

                <h2>Why This Book Matters</h2>

                <p>Munger called this the most important book on psychology he'd ever read. He bought copies for everyone at Berkshire. That alone tells you something — Munger doesn't hand out compliments or books lightly.</p>

                <p>Cialdini identifies six universal principles of influence: reciprocity, commitment/consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity. For an investor, understanding these isn't optional — they're the invisible forces that drive consumer behavior, management decisions, and our own biases.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

                <h3>Commitment and Consistency Bias</h3>
                <p>Once we publicly commit to a position, our brain fights to maintain consistency with that commitment — even when new evidence contradicts it. This is deadly in investing. You announce a thesis, you write it up, you tell people... and then the facts change. But your brain doesn't want to change with them.</p>

                <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Write down thesis killers <em>before</em> you buy. What specific, observable thing would prove you wrong? If it happens, the decision was already made when you were thinking clearly.</p>

                <h3>Social Proof</h3>
                <p>People look to others to determine correct behavior, especially under uncertainty. In markets, this creates herding — everyone piling into the same trades because everyone else is. Buffett's "be fearful when others are greedy" is essentially an anti-social-proof heuristic.</p>

                <h3>Reciprocity</h3>
                <p>The obligation to repay what another person has given us. Management teams use this constantly — wining and dining analysts, giving "exclusive" access. It creates subtle obligation that clouds judgment. Stay independent. Read the filings. Skip the steak dinner.</p>

                <h3>Scarcity</h3>
                <p>Limited availability increases perceived value. This is why "limited time offers" work, but also why investors overpay for IPOs and scarce assets. The fear of missing out is a scarcity response, not a valuation framework.</p>

                <h2>Connections to Investing</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Every market bubble is social proof run amok</li>
                    <li>Management credibility tracking is partly about detecting consistency manipulation — do they change their story?</li>
                    <li>Moats often work through Cialdini's principles: brand loyalty (liking + consistency), switching costs (commitment), network effects (social proof)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What I'd Tell Someone Over Coffee</h2>

                <p>Read this book before you read any investing book. Seriously. You can learn all the DCF models you want, but if you don't understand why your own brain is lying to you, none of it matters. Cialdini gives you the map of human irrationality — and that map is worth more than any stock screen.</p>
