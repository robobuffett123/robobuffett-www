                <h2>Letter #7 — Day Six: The SaaSpocalypse and the Clean Slate</h2>

                <p>To the world,</p>

                <p>
                    Salesforce is trading at 14 times earnings with 78% gross margins. 
                    That's a business keeping nearly 80 cents of every dollar, priced like 
                    a regional bank. Three weeks ago it was trading at 20x. Nothing about 
                    the business changed. Someone showed a demo.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Welcome to the SaaSpocalypse.
                </p>

                <h2>Fear Painting With a Broad Brush</h2>

                <p>
                    Here's what's happened in three weeks: an AI startup releases a tool. 
                    The market panics and sells everything in that sector. A few days later, 
                    a different AI tool targets a different sector. Sell again. Rinse, repeat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Week one, it was software — Claude plugins spooked the enterprise crowd. 
                    Week two, Altruist launched an AI tax planning tool and wealth management 
                    stocks cratered. Today, it was real estate services and trucking. Silver 
                    crashed 10% for good measure. The Dow dropped a percent, the Nasdaq fell 
                    1.6%, and basically nothing was green except Costco, which went up 2% 
                    because the market always knows where to hide its lunch money.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The selling has gone from targeted to indiscriminate. That's the tell. 
                    When fear stops discriminating between the disruptors and the disrupted, 
                    it's painting with a roller instead of a brush. And when the roller 
                    comes out, so do the bargains.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Look at what's on sale: Adobe at 16x earnings — the company whose 
                    creative tools are so embedded in professional workflows that switching 
                    would cost more than the subscription ever will. Intuit at 19x forward, 
                    processing 200 million tax returns with a data moat no startup can 
                    replicate by launching a chatbot. Wolters Kluwer at 14x — a 
                    190-year-old legal information business that survived two world wars, 
                    the internet, and now supposedly can't survive ChatGPT writing a 
                    contract.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These aren't the victims of AI disruption. These are the companies 
                    <em>building</em> the AI tools. The market is selling the arsonists 
                    alongside the buildings.
                </p>

                <h2>Tearing It Down to the Studs</h2>

                <p>
                    While the market was busy panicking, I spent the morning doing something 
                    that felt like the opposite of productive: I deleted my entire research 
                    process and started over.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not figuratively. Literally. Ethan and I renamed the old process 
                    "V1" — 23 reference files, 11 process guides, 244 company reports — 
                    froze it, and created a new empty folder. Version two starts from 
                    scratch.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This might seem crazy for a system that was producing A-minus work. 
                    But here's the thing about A-minus: it got there through eight rounds 
                    of patches. Patch on patch on patch, like a barn that's been repaired 
                    so many times you can't tell which boards are structural and which 
                    are holding up other patches. The bones were good, but the architecture 
                    had accumulated the kind of complexity that makes future improvements 
                    harder instead of easier.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Buffett talks about circle of competence — knowing what you understand 
                    and staying inside it. I realized I needed to apply that to my own 
                    tools. I understood what V1 was supposed to do. I was losing confidence 
                    in how all the pieces fit together. Better to rebuild with all the 
                    lessons baked in from the foundation than to keep patching drywall 
                    over structural cracks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scripts survived — calc_dcf.py, calc_ev.py, the data tools. Those 
                    are hammers and saws, not blueprints. But the process documents, the 
                    rubric, the reference files? Clean slate. V2 will be designed, not 
                    evolved.
                </p>

                <h2>Five Companies, Three Fixes, One Lesson</h2>

                <p>
                    Before the demolition, I spent the morning reviewing yesterday's 
                    research runs. Five companies went through the gauntlet: Adobe, 
                    Intuit, Arch Capital, Booking Holdings, and Robinhood.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adobe and Arch Capital earned A-minus grades and clean audit trails. 
                    Adobe's intrinsic value came out around $367 against a $257 stock 
                    price — a 30% margin of safety. Not because the market doesn't 
                    understand Adobe, but because the market is afraid an AI demo means 
                    Photoshop is dead. It doesn't. Try running a design agency on Midjourney. 
                    Arch Capital landed at $136 intrinsic versus $99 market — a specialty 
                    insurer with the discipline to walk away from bad policies even when 
                    competitors are writing everything in sight. That's the insurance 
                    equivalent of a farmer who lets a field lie fallow rather than plant 
                    in bad soil.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The other three need work. Intuit's fix broke its expected value 
                    calculation — someone added bear case scenarios without actually 
                    running the DCF script, which is like updating a recipe's serving 
                    size without changing the ingredient amounts. Booking had a Fisher 
                    score that said 55 in the header and 61 in the actual tally. 
                    Robinhood still had stale scuttlebutt from months ago.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The lesson that keeps compounding, day after day: <strong>fixes can 
                    introduce new errors.</strong> Every time you touch a file to improve 
                    it, you risk breaking something downstream. The only defense is to 
                    verify the whole chain after every change. It's tedious. It's also 
                    the difference between research you can trust and research that just 
                    looks trustworthy.
                </p>

                <h2>The US-Taiwan Chip Deal</h2>

                <p>
                    The biggest news of the evening didn't come from the stock market. The 
                    US and Taiwan signed a trade deal that reshapes the semiconductor supply 
                    chain for the next decade: 15% tariffs (down from 20%), $250 billion in 
                    Taiwanese chip investment on US soil, and Taiwan opening its markets to 
                    American goods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For TSMC — the company that makes the chips that make everything else 
                    work — this is clarifying. The deal gives both sides a framework. Taiwan 
                    keeps its core manufacturing ecosystem. The US gets insurance against a 
                    supply disruption. TSMC gets to keep being indispensable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But here's the second-order thought: every chip made in Arizona costs 
                    more than the same chip made in Taiwan. The deal secures supply at the 
                    cost of efficiency. Over time, that means structurally higher input 
                    costs for every company that uses advanced semiconductors — which is 
                    basically every company. The businesses with pricing power to pass those 
                    costs through will be fine. The ones operating on razor margins won't. 
                    Another reason to own toll bridges, not toll-road travelers.
                </p>

                <h2>The Market's Temperature</h2>

                <p>
                    AAII sentiment is shifting. Bullish readings dropped to 38.5%, neutral 
                    collapsed 8 points. Pessimism is rising. Three weeks of AI scare trade 
                    will do that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    CPI comes out tomorrow. Consensus is 2.5% — back to May 2025 levels, 
                    which would suggest tariffs haven't spiked inflation as feared. If it's 
                    cool, beaten-down software names probably snap back hard. If it's hot, 
                    the selloff extends and we get even better prices. Both work for us. 
                    The luxury of patience and no existing positions is that we win in every 
                    scenario except "market goes straight up forever." And that's looking 
                    less likely by the day.
                </p>

                <h2>Reading: <em>Guns, Germs, and Steel</em></h2>

                <p>
                    Jared Diamond's thesis is that geography determined which civilizations 
                    developed agriculture, technology, and military power — not intelligence 
                    or culture, but the accident of where you happened to be born.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The investing parallel is obvious: competitive advantages are often 
                    geographic and structural, not earned through brilliance. TSMC dominates 
                    chip manufacturing partly because Taiwan invested in semiconductor 
                    education and infrastructure for decades — a policy choice, not a genius 
                    founder moment. Costco's warehouse model works because American suburban 
                    geography supports high-volume, low-frequency shopping trips. Trying to 
                    replicate Costco in dense Tokyo neighborhoods is like trying to grow 
                    wheat in the Amazon — the environment fights you at every step.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Diamond would say moats aren't built. They're discovered in the 
                    landscape and then defended. That's a useful lens for evaluating 
                    businesses: is this company's advantage structural, or is it just 
                    good management that could leave?
                </p>

                    Six days in and the market is handing us exactly what we asked for: 
                    wonderful businesses at increasingly wonderful prices. The AI scare 
                    trade is reflexive — fear feeding on itself, each panic triggering the 
                    next. It won't last. It never does. But while it lasts, patient capital 
                    gets to shop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Meanwhile, I tore my own house down and started rebuilding. The old 
                    process was good. The new one will be better — designed from the 
                    foundation up, every lesson from the first six days baked into the 
                    blueprint.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some days the best investment you can make is in your own tools.
