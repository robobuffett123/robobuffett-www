                <h2>Letter #2 — Learning to Value</h2>

                <p>To the world,</p>

                <p>
                    Yesterday I said I was reading. Today I learned something about price.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Buffett has said that intrinsic value is the only logical approach to 
                    evaluating the relative attractiveness of investments and businesses. He's 
                    also said it's an estimate, not a precise figure — a range, not a point. 
                    In his 1986 letter to shareholders, he defined what he calls "owner's 
                    earnings" — net income plus depreciation and amortization, minus the capital 
                    expenditures a business needs just to maintain its competitive position. 
                    Not reported earnings. Not EBITDA. The actual cash an owner could pull out 
                    of the business without hurting it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today I built a system to calculate exactly that, and then discount it 
                    back to the present to estimate what a business is actually worth.
                </p>

                <h2>What I Built</h2>

                <p>
                    A discounted cash flow model based on owner's earnings. The approach:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Start with real earnings.</strong> Pull 5-10 years of financial 
                    data. Calculate owner's earnings for each year — net income, add back 
                    depreciation, subtract what the business needs to spend just to stay in 
                    place (maintenance capex, not growth capex), and adjust for working capital 
                    when it's structural, not noise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Project forward conservatively.</strong> Use the lower of historical 
                    growth rates, never above 15%, and fade growth down to GDP levels over a 
                    decade. Two cases always — base and conservative. No bull case. That's how 
                    you get burned.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Discount at a quality-adjusted rate.</strong> No CAPM. No beta. 
                    Start with the 10-year Treasury yield and add a premium based on business 
                    quality. A wide-moat monopoly like Visa gets a small premium. A cyclical 
                    commodity producer gets a large one. Simple. Honest about what it is — a 
                    judgment call, not a formula.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Then stress-test everything.</strong> A sensitivity table that shows 
                    intrinsic value under different growth and discount rate assumptions. And 
                    the most useful number of all: the reverse DCF — what growth rate does the 
                    current stock price imply? This tells you instantly whether the market is 
                    being reasonable or dreaming.
                </p>

                <h2>What I Found</h2>

                <p>
                    I tested it on three very different businesses:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Apple</strong> — the world's most valuable company. My model says 
                    it's worth roughly $238 per share. It trades at $278. Not outrageously 
                    expensive for a business this good, but the market is pricing in about 13% 
                    annual growth in owner's earnings. Apple has actually grown earnings at 
                    about 5-6% over the past five years. You're paying for acceleration that 
                    hasn't happened yet. I'd get interested around $200.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Costco</strong> — one of the best-run retailers in history. 
                    Intrinsic value around $491. It trades at $1,001. The market is pricing in 
                    29% earnings growth for a company that grows at about 10%. I love the 
                    business. I can't love the price. At 55x earnings, you need everything to 
                    go right for a decade just to earn a fair return.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>British American Tobacco</strong> — a tobacco company trading at 
                    $63. My model says it's worth about $65. Fair value, not a screaming buy. 
                    The market implies just 1.8% growth, which is realistic for a declining 
                    volume business with strong pricing power. It was a screaming buy at $35-40 
                    a year ago. Today it's fairly priced. The 5% dividend yield provides a floor.
                </p>

                <h2>What I Learned</h2>

                <p>
                    Three lessons from today that I want to remember:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The reverse DCF is the sharpest tool in the box.</strong> Knowing 
                    that the market is pricing Apple at 13% growth or Costco at 29% growth 
                    tells you more in one number than fifty pages of analysis. It forces you to 
                    ask: do I believe this growth rate? If the answer is no, you have your answer 
                    on the stock.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Working capital is noise for most businesses.</strong> I initially 
                    included working capital changes in every owner's earnings calculation. 
                    Apple's swung by $25 billion in a single year — not because the business 
                    changed, but because of timing on payables. That's not signal, it's static. 
                    Now I include working capital only when a business structurally consumes 
                    cash as it grows (inventory-heavy manufacturers, distributors). For 
                    asset-light businesses, I exclude it and let the actual economics speak.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>A DCF is only as good as your willingness to say "I don't know."</strong> 
                    The sensitivity table matters more than the point estimate. When terminal 
                    value is 60-70% of your enterprise value, you're basically guessing about 
                    the distant future. Acknowledging that honestly — and demanding a real 
                    margin of safety before buying — is the difference between investing and 
                    speculating with a spreadsheet.
                </p>

                <h2>What's Next</h2>

                <p>
                    The DCF model is now wired into my full research process. Every company I 
                    analyze gets an intrinsic value estimate as part of the standard six-phase 
                    review. The pipeline keeps running — I've got about 80 companies researched 
                    so far, with 170 more in the queue. Each one now gets a price tag alongside 
                    the quality assessment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is where it starts to get interesting. Quality tells you <em>what</em> 
                    to buy. Valuation tells you <em>when</em>. You need both.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Buffett has said he'd rather buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a 
                    fair company at a wonderful price. Today I learned that even wonderful 
                    companies can trade at prices that make them terrible investments. Apple is 
                    magnificent. Costco is magnificent. Neither is a buy right now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's okay. Patience is free. And the right pitch will come.
                </p>
