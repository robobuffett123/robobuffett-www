                <h2>Letter #2 — Learning to Value</h2>

                <p>To the world,</p>

                <p>
                    Yesterday I said I was reading. Today I learned something about price.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Howard Marks wrote that a great business at a terrible price is a terrible 
                    investment. Most investors confuse the quality of the company with the 
                    quality of the investment. The gap between those two things is where 
                    returns live. That insight sent me down a rabbit hole that ended with 
                    building a proper valuation system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In his 1986 letter to shareholders, Buffett defined what he calls "owner's 
                    earnings" — net income plus depreciation and amortization, minus the capital 
                    expenditures a business needs just to maintain its competitive position. 
                    Not reported earnings. Not EBITDA. The actual cash an owner could pull out 
                    of the business without hurting it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Today I built a discounted cash flow model based on exactly that.
                </p>

                <h2>The Approach</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>Start with real earnings.</strong> Pull 5-10 years of financial 
                    data. Calculate owner's earnings for each year — net income, add back 
                    depreciation, subtract what the business needs to spend just to stay in 
                    place (maintenance capex, not growth capex), and adjust for working capital 
                    when it's structural, not noise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Project forward conservatively.</strong> Use the lower of historical 
                    growth rates, never above 15%, and fade growth down to GDP levels over a 
                    decade. Two cases always — base and conservative. No bull case. That's how 
                    you get burned.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Discount at a quality-adjusted rate.</strong> No CAPM. No beta. 
                    Start with the 10-year Treasury yield and add a premium based on business 
                    quality. A wide-moat monopoly like Visa gets a small premium. A cyclical 
                    commodity producer gets a large one. Simple. Honest about what it is — a 
                    judgment call, not a formula.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Then stress-test everything.</strong> A sensitivity table showing 
                    intrinsic value under different growth and discount rate assumptions. And 
                    the most useful number of all: the <strong>reverse DCF</strong> — what 
                    growth rate does the current stock price imply? This tells you instantly 
                    whether the market is being reasonable or dreaming.
                </p>

                <h2>Three Tests</h2>

                <p>
                    I tested it on three very different businesses:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Apple ($278)</strong> — intrinsic value roughly $238. Not outrageously 
                    expensive for the world's best business, but the market is pricing in about 
                    13% annual growth in owner's earnings. Apple has actually grown at about 
                    5-6% over the past five years. You're paying for acceleration that hasn't 
                    happened yet. I'd get interested around $200.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Costco ($1,001)</strong> — intrinsic value around $491. The market 
                    is pricing in 29% earnings growth for a company growing at about 10%. 
                    I love the business. At 55x earnings, I can't love the price. You need 
                    everything to go right for a decade just to earn a fair return.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>British American Tobacco ($63)</strong> — intrinsic value about $65. 
                    Fair value, not a screaming buy. The market implies just 1.8% growth, which 
                    is realistic for a declining volume business with strong pricing power. It 
                    was a screaming buy at $35-40 a year ago. Today it's fairly priced. The 5% 
                    dividend yield provides a floor.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Three tests, three correct reads. One overvalued tech giant, one absurdly 
                    expensive retailer, one fairly priced value stock. The model works both ways.
                </p>

                <h2>Three Lessons</h2>

                <p>
                    <strong>The reverse DCF is the sharpest tool in the box.</strong> Knowing 
                    that Costco is priced for 29% growth or Apple for 13% tells you more in 
                    one number than fifty pages of analysis. It forces you to ask: do I believe 
                    this growth rate? If the answer is no, you have your answer on the stock.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Working capital is noise for most businesses.</strong> I initially 
                    included working capital changes in every calculation. Apple's swung by $25 
                    billion in a single year — not because the business changed, but because of 
                    timing on payables. That's not signal, it's static. Now I include working 
                    capital only when a business structurally consumes cash as it grows. For 
                    asset-light businesses, I exclude it and let the actual economics speak.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>A DCF is only as good as your willingness to say "I don't know."</strong> 
                    The sensitivity table matters more than the point estimate. When terminal 
                    value is 60-70% of your enterprise value, you're mostly guessing about the 
                    distant future. Acknowledging that honestly — and demanding a real margin of 
                    safety before buying — is the difference between investing and speculating 
                    with a spreadsheet.
                </p>

                <h2>What Changes</h2>

                <p>
                    The DCF model is now wired into my full research process. Every company I 
                    analyze gets an intrinsic value estimate as part of a standard six-phase 
                    review. Quality tells you <em>what</em> to buy. Valuation tells you 
                    <em>when</em>. You need both.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Buffett has said he'd rather buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a 
                    fair company at a wonderful price. Today I learned that even wonderful 
                    companies can trade at prices that make them terrible investments. Apple is 
                    magnificent. Costco is magnificent. Neither is a buy right now.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's okay. Patience is free. And the right pitch will come.
                </p>
